# ABV (Alcohol By Volume) calculator and brix to specific gravity converter

- Finds ABV based on gravity change. If you took an original gravity reading (or had estimated OG), and also took a final gravity (FG) reading prior to adding priming sugar at bottling you can find out your batch's alcohol by volume ABV.
- Convert brix to specific gravity and vice versa.
